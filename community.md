# About

## The SCITT Community

The SCITT Community, the people behind this website and its efforts, are volunteers passionate about not only the [IETF SCITT standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/){:target="_blank"} but a variety of supply chain and transparency technologies.

## The IETF SCITT Working Group

The IETF Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust Working Group is the group of volunteers who formally maintain the [SCITT Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/){:target="_blank"}, the [SCITT Reference API](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi/){:target="_blank"}, and other draft specifications and finalized standards for the scope of work defined in [its current charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/){:target="_blank"}.
