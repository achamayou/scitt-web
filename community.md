# About

## The SCITT Community

The SCITT Community, the people behind this website and its efforts, are volunteers passionate about not only [the official SCITT standards](#the-ietf-scitt-working-group), but a variety of supply chain and transparency technologies.

## The IETF SCITT Working Group

The IETF Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust Working Group is the group of volunteers who formally maintain the [SCITT Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/), [the SCITT Reference API](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi/), and other draft specifications and finalized standards for the scope of work defined in [its current charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/).

# Getting Involved 

## The SCITT Community

There are multiple ways to involve yourself in our community.

- Join [our groups.io mailing list](https://groups.io/g/scitt-community), give feedback on the email threads of others, or start your very own.
- Attend our bi-weekly community meetings to discuss a variety of topics, ask questions, and better understand where your interests intersect with the group. We [meet online](https://meet.google.com/rek-mbak-nxv) every two weeks at [16:00 UTC](https://time.is/compare/300PM_5_June_2024_in_UTC/Tokyo/California/New_York/London) and more information can be found in our [online iCalendar feed](/assets/schedule.ics).

## The IETF SCITT Working Group

If you want to provide feedback or directly contribute to the core SCITT specifications, IETF has [general guidance](https://www.ietf.org/participate/) for how to participate and [the SCITT work group has a dedicated page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/) about its charter, specifications, mailing lists, Zulip chat, and other ways to engage.
